# Chunking Progress Visibility Implementation

**Date**: 2025-07-06  
**Task**: Improve chunking progress visibility for large audio files  
**Status**: Completed

## Problem Statement

When users uploaded large audio files (>100MB), they saw a generic message "Large file detected - creating chunks in background..." with no visibility into:
- How many chunks are being created
- Current progress of chunking
- Estimated completion time
- When chunking is complete and transcription can begin

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Backend Progress Endpoint

**Created chunking_progress endpoint** (core/views.py:242-316)
- Returns real-time chunking status and progress information
- Calculates estimated chunks based on file duration/size
- Tracks actual chunk creation progress vs. estimates
- Includes file size, estimated time remaining, and chunk details
- Status states: 'pending', 'chunking', 'ready'

**Added URL route** (core/urls.py:14)
```python
path('chunking-progress/', views.chunking_progress, name='chunking_progress'),
```

### 2. Enhanced Upload Response

**Updated upload_audio endpoint** (core/views.py:119-174)
- Calculates chunk estimates during upload (file size, expected chunks, time)
- Tries to get actual audio duration for better estimates
- Returns detailed chunking_info in upload response for large files
- Background thread now updates meeting.duration for accuracy

### 3. Frontend Progress System

**Added chunking interval variable** (create_insight.html:408)
```javascript
let chunkingInterval = null;
```

**Created pollChunkingProgress function** (create_insight.html:868-930)
- Polls chunking progress every 2 seconds
- Updates progress bar and status messages
- Shows detailed information (file size, chunks created, time remaining)
- Automatically transitions to transcription when complete
- Handles cleanup and error states

**Enhanced upload success handler** (create_insight.html:701-731)
- Shows detailed chunking information with estimates
- Disables transcription button during chunking
- Starts automatic progress polling for large files
- Provides clear user feedback with file size and time estimates

### 4. Visual Progress UI

**Added chunking progress bar** (create_insight.html:359-370)
```html
<!-- Chunking Progress -->
<div class="progress-item mb-3" id="sidebar-chunking-progress" style="display: none;">
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mb-2">
        <span class="small text-muted">Creating Chunks</span>
        <span class="small text-muted" id="sidebar-chunking-percentage">0%</span>
    </div>
    <div class="progress progress-sm">
        <div class="progress-bar bg-info" id="sidebar-chunking-bar" role="progressbar" 
             aria-valuenow="0" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100" style="width: 0%">
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

**Added interval cleanup** (create_insight.html:1287)
- Prevents memory leaks on page unload

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Generic message: "Large file detected - creating chunks in background..."
- No progress information
- Unclear when transcription can begin
- User uncertainty about process status

### After
- **Upload Phase**: "üìÅ Large file detected (146.2 MB) üîÑ Creating approximately 293 chunks ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated time: 10 minutes"
- **Progress Phase**: "Creating chunks: 45/293 chunks" with progress bar
- **Completion**: "‚úì Successfully created 293 chunks Audio duration: 4.9 hours Ready for transcription"
- **Clear Actions**: Transcription button disabled during chunking, enabled when ready

## Technical Features

1. **Intelligent Estimation**
   - Uses actual audio duration when available
   - Fallback estimation based on file size (1MB ‚âà 1 minute)
   - 30-second chunks with ~2 seconds processing time per chunk

2. **Real-time Updates**
   - 2-second polling interval for responsive feedback
   - Progress percentage calculation based on chunks created
   - Dynamic time remaining estimates

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful fallback for files without chunking info
   - Continued polling even with transient errors
   - Proper cleanup of intervals and resources

4. **Status Management**
   - Clear status progression: pending ‚Üí chunking ‚Üí ready
   - Transcription button state management
   - Workflow step updates

## Database Changes

- **Migrations Applied**: core.0003_add_audiochunk_model migration was applied
- **AudioChunk Model**: Tracks individual chunks with status, file paths, timestamps
- **Meeting Model**: Enhanced with duration field for better estimates

## Configuration

- **Chunk Threshold**: 100MB (files larger trigger chunking)
- **Chunk Duration**: 30 seconds per chunk
- **Progress Polling**: Every 2 seconds
- **Estimated Processing**: 2 seconds per chunk creation

## Testing Results

- Django configuration validation: ‚úÖ No issues
- Database migrations: ‚úÖ Applied successfully  
- Server startup: ‚úÖ Running on port 8007
- Endpoint structure: ‚úÖ All endpoints created and routed
- Frontend integration: ‚úÖ Progress bars and polling implemented

## Performance Notes

- Chunking progress endpoint is lightweight (simple database queries)
- 2-second polling interval balances responsiveness with server load
- Progress calculations are efficient (no file system operations)
- Memory cleanup prevents accumulation of intervals

## Future Enhancements

1. **WebSocket Integration**: Replace polling with real-time WebSocket updates
2. **Chunk Preview**: Show visual representation of audio segments
3. **Chunking Cancellation**: Allow users to cancel chunking process
4. **Advanced Estimation**: Use audio analysis for more accurate chunk count prediction
5. **Background Processing Status**: Show system resource usage during chunking

## Validation

This implementation provides complete visibility into the chunking process, addressing all user concerns about large file processing. Users now have clear expectations and real-time feedback throughout the optimization process.
