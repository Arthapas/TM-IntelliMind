# Working Log: Icon-Only Buttons and Table UI Optimization

**Date**: 2025-07-06  
**Task**: Update meeting table buttons to icon-only and optimize table layout  
**Status**: Completed

## Technical Changes

### 1. Fixed Delete Button Network Error
- **File**: `core/templates/core/base.html:600-614`
- Updated `getCSRFToken()` function to read from cookie when form field not present
- Fixed "Network error occurred while deleting meeting" issue

### 2. Updated Table Action Buttons to Icon-Only
- **File**: `core/templates/core/home.html:49,60-70`
- Removed "View Detail" and "Delete" text from buttons
- Changed Action column header to gear icon
- Added proper title attributes for accessibility

### 3. Optimized Table Layout
- **File**: `core/templates/core/home.html:205-251`
- Added custom CSS for column width optimization:
  - Meeting Name: 25%
  - Summary: 50% (main content area)
  - Date: 15%
  - Actions: 10% (compact for icons)
- Changed from `btn-group` to individual `btn-sm` buttons
- Added responsive behavior (hides summary on mobile)

## Features Modified

1. **Delete Functionality**: Now properly retrieves CSRF token from cookie
2. **Table UI**: Cleaner, more modern with icon-only actions
3. **Space Utilization**: Summary column gets more space for content
4. **Mobile Responsive**: Graceful degradation on smaller screens

## Performance & Validation

- Tested delete functionality: Working correctly with fade animation
- Verified button tooltips appear on hover
- Confirmed responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- No JavaScript errors in console

## Next Steps

- Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Could implement bulk actions if needed
- Potential for adding sorting/filtering to table
