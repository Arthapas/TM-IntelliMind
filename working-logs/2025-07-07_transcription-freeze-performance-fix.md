# Transcription Freeze Performance Fix

**Date**: 2025-07-07
**Task**: Fix critical transcription freeze on long audio files (95+ minutes)
**Status**: Completed

## Problem Identified

Meeting `4882b1e8-8a23-4a55-994d-813bc2d74c15` froze at chunk 22 with these critical issues:

### Root Causes:
1. **Chunk Limit Too Restrictive**: 
   - Audio: 5703s (~95 minutes)
   - Required: 114 chunks (30s each)  
   - System limit: 100 chunks (only covered ~83 minutes)

2. **Extremely Slow Processing**:
   - Normal: 5-20 seconds per chunk
   - Stuck chunks: 300+ seconds (chunk 43: 379.51s, chunk 44: 379.53s)
   - Performance: 0.2x real-time vs expected 3-15x

3. **Queue Overload**:
   - Queue buildup to 48+ items
   - System creating chunks faster than processing

4. **Resource Contention**:
   - 3 concurrent threads competing for memory/CPU
   - M4 system overwhelmed with multiple heavy operations

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Increased Limits (`core/audio_chunking.py`)
```python
# Before: 100 chunks max
self.max_chunks = getattr(settings, 'AUDIO_MAX_CHUNKS', 150)  # +50%
self.max_duration = getattr(settings, 'AUDIO_MAX_DURATION', 7200)  # 2 hours cap
```

### 2. Aggressive Timeout Reduction (`core/chunk_transcription.py`)
```python
# Before: 180s timeout
timeout=90  # Reduced by 50% for faster stuck detection
```

### 3. Enhanced Watchdog (`core/progressive_transcription.py`)
```python
# Before: 120s timeout, 10s checks
self.thread_timeout = 100  # 1.67 minutes (was 2 minutes)
self.watchdog_interval = 5  # Check every 5s (was 10s)
```

### 4. Reduced Concurrency
```python
# Before: 3 concurrent threads
max_concurrent_transcriptions: int = 2  # Reduced to 2 threads
```

### 5. Performance Monitoring & Auto-Adjustment
```python
# New: Track slow chunks and reduce concurrency
if chunk_duration > 30:  # Chunk took longer than 30 seconds
    self.slow_chunk_count += 1
    if self.slow_chunk_count >= 3:
        self.performance_degraded = True  # Switch to single-threaded
```

### 6. Faster Recovery
```python
# Before: 2 retries
self.max_retries = 1  # Reduced to 1 for faster recovery
```

## Files Modified

1. `core/audio_chunking.py:44-45,279-288`
   - Increased chunk limit to 150 and added 2-hour duration cap
   - Added duration checking in addition to chunk count

2. `core/chunk_transcription.py:90`
   - Reduced chunk timeout from 180s to 90s

3. `core/progressive_transcription.py:35,64-67,165-168,309-318`
   - Reduced max concurrent from 3 to 2 threads
   - Faster watchdog checks (5s interval, 100s timeout)  
   - Added performance monitoring with auto-degradation
   - Reduced retry attempts from 2 to 1

## Testing & Validation

### Before Fix:
- Chunks 43-45 stuck for 300+ seconds each
- Queue buildup to 48+ items
- Only 80/100 chunks completed, 17 pending, 3 stuck
- UI completely frozen

### After Fix:
- Stuck chunks reset and requeued successfully
- Processing restarted with optimized settings
- Reduced resource contention with 2 concurrent threads
- Faster detection and recovery from slow chunks

## Performance Impact

**Timeout Improvements**:
- Chunk timeout: 180s → 90s (-50%)
- Watchdog timeout: 120s → 100s (-17%)
- Watchdog checks: 10s → 5s (-50%)

**Resource Management**:
- Max concurrent: 3 → 2 threads (-33%)
- Auto-degrade to single-threaded when performance issues detected
- Retry attempts: 2 → 1 (-50%)

**Limits**:
- Max chunks: 100 → 150 (+50%)
- Max duration: unlimited → 7200s (2 hours)

## Recovery Process Used

```bash
# 1. Reset stuck chunks
AudioChunk.objects.filter(status='processing').update(status='pending')

# 2. Re-queue with optimized settings  
for chunk in pending_chunks:
    add_chunk_to_transcription_queue(chunk)
```

## Future Recommendations

1. **Progressive UI Updates**: Add frontend timeout protection
2. **Memory Monitoring**: Track RAM usage and throttle accordingly  
3. **Model Optimization**: Consider using smaller models for very long files
4. **Chunk Size Adjustment**: Dynamic chunk sizing based on file length
5. **Queue Management**: Implement priority queuing for retry chunks
